                <p>The photo shown above is a collection of some of my top favorite and recommended Korean skincare products. In it, there is a jade face roller, a beauty tool that not many would know about or understand how to use unless they are a big skincare enthusiast. I love Korean skincare; they are much more affordable than others on the market and are effective. I discovered them about 6 years ago and have been trying different products to develop a routine that suits my skin the best. I have seen a lot of improvements since I started my skincare journey, which does wonders for my self-confidence.</p>

                <p><em>Original article: <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/">10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills - The New York Times (nytimes.com)</a></em></p>

                <p>The use of visual aids is greatly welcome when it comes to required school readings, especially when they are large chunks of dense text that I usually dread reading. Like the article mentioned above, I want to quickly go through the information and move on to the next phase. However, that doesn’t always work out and sometimes backfires because I’m not actually taking the time to absorb and understand the information.</p>

                <p>Additionally, it can’t just be a random photo or illustration when choosing visual aids. It has to relate to the text I’m reading, otherwise, I’ll just get distracted or ignore it. When they are used correctly, I find it much easier to understand the content of the textbook or coursework. In the end, visual aids not only make me pause to absorb the information, but also makes the process go much faster.</p>

                <h2>Overlays Design Pattern Research</h2>
                <time>February 7, 2023</time>

                <p><em>Original article: <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows | by Naema Baskanderi | UX Planet</a></em></p>

                <p>Modals and overlays simplify the design process and user interface. It allows users to perform several actions without needing to open another tab or page. In my opinion, the best and number one practice for modals(the article lists that as number 6), would be having them triggered by the users, as opposed to pop-ups that continuously spam users and obscuring their view.</p>
                
                <p>These pop-up modals have become increasingly troublesome and a frequent occurrence in many sites I visit daily. They usually come in the form of email subscriptions or notifications with an offered discount to encourage users to participate. It is often disguised as optional and free; however, occasionally, they won’t have an exit button to force users to participate.</p>

                <time>January 31, 2023</time>

                <p><em>Original article: <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best practices for form design. The ultimate goal of a website or a… | by Salim Ansari | UX Collective (uxdesign.cc)</a></em></p>
                
                <p>As a Web Content Assistant, I regularly have to work with and create web forms for several UC Davis websites, so this article did a great job in breaking down the Do’s and Don’ts of forms. After reading this article, I realized that there were a couple of things I could have done better or differently so that users have the best experience. For obvious reasons, I can’t control the amount of input fields but I could have found a better way to display them. I will continue to refer back to this article for future use to ensure that I can provide the best practices to form design.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.hellofresh.com/plans">HelloFresh</a> has one of the best and easiest webforms to use; it provides a progress bar depicting a clear picture of the number of steps users need to complete. Additionally, the steps are short and concise with icon images to help aid the users.
