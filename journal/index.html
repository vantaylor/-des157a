                <p>The use of visual aids is greatly welcome when it comes to required school readings, especially when they are large chunks of dense text, text that I usually dread reading.</p>

                <h2>Overlays Design Pattern Research</h2>

                <p><em>Original article: <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows | by Naema Baskanderi | UX Planet</a></em></p>

                <p>Modals and overlays simplify the design process and user interface. It allows users to perform several actions without needing to open another tab or page. In my opinion, the best and number one practice for modals(the article lists that as number 6), would be having them triggered by the users, as opposed to pop-ups that continuously spam users and obscuring their view.</p>
                
                <p>These pop-up modals have become increasingly troublesome and a frequent occurrence in many sites I visit daily. They usually come in the form of email subscriptions or notifications with an offered discount to encourage users to participate. It is often disguised as optional and free; however, occasionally, they won’t have an exit button to force users to participate.</p>

                <p>As a Web Content Assistant, I regularly have to work with and create web forms for several UC Davis websites, so this article did a great job in breaking down the Do’s and Don’ts of forms. After reading this article, I realized that there were a couple of things I could have done better or differently so that users have the best experience. For obvious reasons, I can’t control the amount of input fields but I could have found a better way to display them. I will continue to refer back to this article for future use to ensure that I can provide the best practices to form design.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.hellofresh.com/plans">HelloFresh</a> has one of the best and easiest webforms to use; it provides a progress bar depicting a clear picture of the number of steps users need to complete. Additionally, the steps are short and concise with icon images to help aid the users.
