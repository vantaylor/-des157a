            <h2>Project Summary</h2>

            <p>I plan to expland and develop my Every Picture Project for the Finals with more visuals, user interaction and/or animation to enhance the user experience.</p>

            <h2>Project Goals</h2>
            <p>The current project uses a simple grid layout the display my images with a click function to activate the pop-up modals with my narrative/description. My goal is to expereiment more with the grids layout and incorpoate more intersting visuals/graphics. Additionally, the current topic is about my passion for skincare, however, I may change it to my time in Hong Kong and Taiwan, specifically the foods. Doing so will provide a more interesting narrative and user experience as I feel like I can expereiment more with my images and layout.</p>

            <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
            <p>For my overall design, the main focus will be on the images. I plan on including a full screen hero image with the title over it. The color palette will be soft and muted as to not draw too much attention. I will use a clean, geometric typeface for legibility. The plan is to create a image grid or gallery of different image sizes and make it responsive.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
            <p>Same as the current project, I will include a hover effect to the images and a pop-up modal that is activated through clicking on the image. Since I plan on adding a full screen hero image, I want to include a jump function/button at the bottom of the hero that is anchored to the gallery below it. The bonus challenge is make the hero image an automaic slideshow that fades between 2-4 images.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
            <p>As I mention in the Project Goal section, the plan is to switch my current Every Picture topic to my time in Asia, so that I can provide a more interesting narrative. I feel like my current topic around skincare may not be interesting enough. By switching to my time in Hong Kong and Taiwan, I can show my audience the beauty of it and all the delicious food. If the users have the opportunity to go, they can come back to my page for food recommendations.</p>
