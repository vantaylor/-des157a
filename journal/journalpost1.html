            <p>As a Web Content Assistant, I regularly have to work with and create web forms for several UC Davis websites, so this article did a great job in breaking down the Do’s and Don’t of forms. After reading this article, I realized that there were a couple of things I could have done better or differently so that users have the best experience. For obvious reasons, I can’t control the amount of input fields but I could have found a better way to display them. I will continue to refer back to this article for future use to ensure that I can provide the best practices to form design.</p>
