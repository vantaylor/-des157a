            <h2>COSRX - Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence</h2>

            <p>This is a perfect boost in hydration which is perfect for the cold winter months and has a smoothing effect on the skin. Ideal for those who has textured skin wants that Korean "Glass Skin" look. The Snail Mucin Essence was introduced to my routine about 3 months ago and my skin looks a lot more plump and hydrated since I started using it. I use it every night after my toning and sometimes in my morning skincare routine if I feel like my skin needs something extra.</p>

            <h2>COSRX - Comfort Ceramide Cream Mist</h2>

            <p>This has been my life saver during the cold winter months. My skin would usually become dry as the day goes by, so a spritz of this over my face re-hydrates it. It also works well in the summer to cool down face on a hot day. You could even use this over your makeup to make it more dewy looking. The ceramides in it is major plus for soothing sensitive or irritated skin.</p>

            <h2>Beauty of Joseon - Relief Sun: Rice + Probiotic SPF50+ PA++++</h2>

            <p>I have tried a lot of facial sunscreen in the past and nothing compares to the Beauty of Joseon one. The ones I've tried previously, either clogged my poors, stung my face, or burned my eyes.</p>

            <h2>Hanskin - Vitamin C Glow Serum</h2>

            <p>This serum has 10% abscorbic acid, so I wouldn't recommend people who are new to vitamin c to this. If you are new, I suggest you try a product with less, such as Klairs' 5% one, then build up from there. I have been using this serum for about 2 years now and have noticed brighter skin. </p>
